**ABOUT DATASET**

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.



**COLUMN DESCRIPTION FOR DIABETES DATA:**

• Pregnancies • Glucose • Blood Pressure • Skin Thickness • Insulin • BMI • Diabetes • Age • Outcome



From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

**Conclusion:**

From the above output we can infer that logistic regression model gives up the best results with 77% percent accurracy, closely followeed by Naive Bayes model with 80% accuracy.
